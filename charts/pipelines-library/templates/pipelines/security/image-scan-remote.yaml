spec:
  description: >-
    The 'image-scan-remote' Tekton pipeline is used for scanning container images as part of the CI/CD process.
    To streamline and standardize its usage, a dedicated TriggerTemplate must be created
    with the necessary parameters for basic scan operations.
  params:
    - name: IMAGE_NAMES
      type: array
      description: List of container images to be scanned. Each image can be in the format
        `registry/repository/image:tag` or `registry/repository/image`.
    - name: COMPONENT_NAME
      type: string
      description: Name of the component to which the images belong.
        Pipeline will use this name to create/update the appropriate
        Engagement with scan reports in DefectDojo.
  results:
    - description: DefectDojo URL with the generated vulnerability scan reports
      name: SCAN_REPORT_URL
      type: string
      value: $(tasks.image-scan.results.SCAN_REPORT_URL)
